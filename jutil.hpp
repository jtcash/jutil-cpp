/**
 *  A set of header files to provide useful tools to aid in development and debugging.
 *  jutil is expected to rely heavily on C++17 features, and targets GCC, though MSVC support is
 * expected for most features.
 *  Everything, except for the occasional macro definition when unavoidable, is contained in
 * the `jeff` namespace.
